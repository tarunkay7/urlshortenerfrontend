## Frontend for URL Shortener

In this React code snippet, I developed a URL shortener application using the Chakra UI component library for a sleek and modern user interface. The app allows users to enter a long URL and generates a shortened URL for easy sharing and accessibility. Let me summarize the code and explain the key aspects of its implementation.

First, I imported the necessary components and libraries from React, Chakra UI, and other dependencies such as axios for making HTTP requests. I also imported specific icons for visual elements like the copy icon.

The main component, `App`, is a functional component that uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the shortened URL. The `shortURL` state variable holds the generated short URL, which is initially empty.

Inside the component, I defined the `generateShortURL` function, which is responsible for making an asynchronous request to the backend API and generating the shortened URL. It takes the user's input `values` (containing the long URL) as a parameter. The function uses the `axios` library to send a POST request to the specified endpoint (`http://localhost:8080/generate`) and awaits the response. If the request is successful, the returned short URL is set in the `shortURL` state variable.

To copy the generated short URL to the clipboard, I implemented the `copyToClipboard` function. This function creates a temporary text area element, sets its value to the desired text (in this case, the short URL), selects the text, and executes the copy command. After that, the temporary element is removed from the DOM.

The main JSX structure of the component begins with the `ChakraProvider` component, which provides the Chakra UI theme and styling to the entire app. The app is enclosed in a `Box` component with a gray background color to create a visually pleasing layout.

The `Container` component from Chakra UI sets the maximum width and centers the content vertically. Within this container, I placed a `Heading` component to display the app's title, "URL Shortener," in a teal color, creating a visually appealing and attention-grabbing heading.

The user input form is wrapped in another `Box` component, which has a white background and padding to separate it from the surrounding elements. Inside this box, I used the `Formik` component to handle form submission and form field management. The initial value of the input field is set to an empty string.

The form consists of a single input field wrapped in a `Field` component from Formik. The `Field` component provides the `field` object, which contains necessary properties and event handlers for input field management. I utilized the `FormControl` and `InputGroup` components from Chakra UI to create a visually pleasing input field with an accompanying "Generate" button. The user can enter a URL in the input field, and upon clicking the "Generate" button, the `handleSubmit` function is called.

If a short URL is generated and stored in the `shortURL` state variable, it is rendered in an input field below the form. The input field is marked as read-only and displays the generated short URL. An adjacent copy button allows users to copy the URL to their clipboard. Clicking the copy button triggers the `copyToClipboard` function, which copies the URL to the clipboard for easy sharing.

Overall, this React code showcases my implementation of a URL shortener application with a clean and user-friendly interface. By utilizing React, Chakra UI, and other libraries, I was able to create a responsive and visually appealing app that allows users to generate and copy shortened URLs effortlessly.
